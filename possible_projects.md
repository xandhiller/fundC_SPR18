# Suggested Group Projects 
# `Fundamentals of C Programming (48430)`

These projects are '_suggested_', as they appear to the teaching staff to have
significant technical requirements that will allow you to practice your C
programming skills.

You may still choose something of your own, though these projects will give you
enough scope to score well on the marking criteria for the group project.

## 1. Matrix Manipulation Software
A command line interface should be built that supports the following operations:

* Generation of arbitrarily sized arrays of numerical values using a uniform 
  syntax.
* Operations should include: 
    * Element-wise division
    * Element-wise multiplication
    * Vector addition/subtraction
    * Matrix multiplication
    * Appropriate errors for invalid operations
* Storage of variables into a file for later reloading (essentially, the
  ability to save your work).
* Saving of previously entered commands into a file that never exceeds a
  reasonable byte size or line count.
  
  
## 2. Flashcard Program
A terminal based program with three modes:

1. The generation of flashcards into organised 'decks'.
2. The use of the stored flashcards -- i.e. The question is posed, the user can 
   then prompt the computer to print out the solution after they have had the 
   chance to answer. 
3. Reporting of performance statistics on a per-deck basis.

Other requirements are:

* Saving of flashcards into named and ordered 'decks' of cards.
* Saving of performance statistics.
* Organised storage of 'decks' that can be easily navigated in a file browser.

## 3. Two-Dimensional Plotting in the Terminal
Given two arbitrarily sized vectors, plot them in a cartesian plot in the
terminal.

Other requirements:

* Colour must be used when printing to the terminal (you may want to 
  investigate the escape characters for colour in the terminal).
* Plot must be saved as a plain text file in an organised manner within the
  directory where the program is used.
* Axes should be labelled.
* User should be able to decide if data should be input either via a 
  command-line interface or via file.
  
## 4. (?) Generation of Ciphers for Input Text

You may use any of the following ciphers:

* <++>

With any of these, after being encoded, output should be sent to a file or 
terminal an encoded version.

## 5. Timezone Converter and Calendar Calculations
<++>

## 6. Text Input Searching/Pattern Matching
<++>

## 7. Symbolic Algebra Program
<++>
